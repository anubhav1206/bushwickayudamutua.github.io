# Our Privacy & Security Principles 

The privacy of the people in our community, including those we seek to help and those that volunteer to help them, is a top priority. As our organization evolves, we will continue to progress in the way we handle information, so that everyone who works with us has confidence that their information is private, safe, and secure. We expect and train all of our organizers and volunteers to follow the same guidelines.

## Information Collected

- Only information truly necessary to accomplish a help request is mandatory to provide. Information like gender identity, age, sex, nationality, religion, immigration status, or apartment number will never be logged or collected.
- If requested, we will delete all of your data no questions asked.

## When Working With Outside Organizations & Tools
- We will vet every tool and organization to ensure your data is protected and secure 
- We will review the privacy, data, and tech policies of other organizations - we work with to ensure your information is protected and secure
- We will NEVER sell your information to other organizations
- We will NEVER send your information to other organizations without your written and explicit permission
