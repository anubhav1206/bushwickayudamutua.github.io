#### All volunteers should:
- Wear at least 2 masks or a KN95 mask.
- Refrain from touching their faces and maintain social distance (6ft).
- Refrain from taking their masks down to eat or drink unless they are outside and 6ft away from others. 
- Coordinators will be responsible for making sure there are always masks and hand sanitizer available on site for volunteers and folks receiving assistance.
- Everyone receiving assistance must be wearing a mask (Masks will be available on site and volunteers will hand out masks as needed).

#### All coordinators will:
- Review safety protocols with all volunteers on site before they begin any volunteer work every week.
- Coordinators should be operating as though someone in the room has COVID at every event/food distro.

####  If you expect you have been exposed or have tested positive: 
- Alert the coordinator that was on-site with you ASAP and/or email Bushwickayudamutua@gmail.com 
- Please include your name and phone number, so that weâ€™re able to connect with you to learn more about where and who else may have been exposed at the event. 
- We will keep your identity private. 

#### In case of a COVID positive case on site:
- All volunteers and coordinators will be contacted and asked to wait 2 weeks prior to returning or have a negative test conducted at least 7 days after potential exposure.
