# Bushwick Ayuda Mutua

This is the source code for the [`jekyll`]-based website of Bushwick Ayuda Mutua, located at [https://bushwickayudamutua.com/]

### Running the site locally

You'll need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for npm, and ruby and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/). We're currently running these versions:
- `node`: `v14.18.1`
- `npm`: `6.14.15`
- `ruby`: `3.0.2p107`
- `jekyll`: 

You should be able to install these on Mac OS X by running the following series of commands:

```bash
brew install ruby node@14
gem install bundler
```

Now clone the repo, go to the folder in your terminal and run `bundle exec make serve`.

When it's running, go to [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000) on your browser.
